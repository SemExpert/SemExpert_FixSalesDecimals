## Getting Started

### Prerequisitos

The module requires a completely installed and functional copy of Magento 2.2

### Installation

Add the module as a dependency to your Magento project 

Edit composer.json

```json
{
  "require": {
    "semexpert/module-fix-sales-decimals": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

then

```bash
php composer.phar install
```

or with `composer require`

```bash
php composer.phar require semexpert/module-fix-sales-decimals
```

After installing the package, you need to enable the module from Magento CLI

```bash
php bin/magento module:enable SemExpert_FixSalesDecimals
```

## Running the tests

All the included tests can be run from the Magento CLI. Refer to the 
[documentation](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/config-guide/cli/config-cli-subcommands-test.html).

### Included tests

The same tets that were included in the original Pull Request are provided but as integration tests.

There are additional unit tests specific for the plugin funcionality.

### Coding Styles

All the provided code follows the 
[Magento 2 coding standard](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.2/coding-standards/bk-coding-standards.html).

## Deployment

This module should not be used in Magento 2.3+ as the referenced fixes have already been applied. This is reflected on 
the version dependencies so you will need to explicitly remove it to upgrade Magento.

```bash
php composer.phar remove semexpert/module-fix-sales-decimals
```

You should also consider removing it if the fix ever makes it into Magento 2.2.

## Magento 2
